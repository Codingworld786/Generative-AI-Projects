Take the next step with the\\nDeep Learning Specialization\\n!\\nEnroll Now\\nWhat Learners Are Saying\\n“As a Behavioral Scientist, I was able to adopt methods to understand my customers better, overcome the traditional ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, and design interventions which account for personality and individual differences.”\\nLuo Yuzheng\\nAssistant Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore\\n“I gained confidence in my knowledge of machine learning. Since then, I’ve become a machine learning mentor, got a research paper published in IEEE, decided to pursue my Masters in Machine Learning, and was able to land a job at JP Morgan Chase.”\\nChirag Godawat\\nData Engineer, Vista\\n“The Machine Learning course became a guiding light. Andrew Ng explains concepts with simple visualizations and plots. I learned how to evaluate my training results and explain the outcomes to my colleagues, boss, and even the vice president of our company.”\\nHsin-Wen Chang\\nSr. C++ Developer, Zealogics\\n“The Machine Learning course helped develop my problem-solving skills, inspired an attitude of experimentation, and shaped a passion for machine learning. Since then, I have automated several investment processes and experimented with investment data.”\\nNicholas Muchinguri\\nSenior Trader, Vanguard Australia\\n“The Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng expanded my knowledge, so I could write a research paper on Facial Emotion Recognition and land an internship at Morgan Stanley.”\\nAakash Saroop\\nStudent, K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering\\n“In 2017, the Machine Learning course helped me gain a deep insight into Natural Language Processing and got me thinking about a new ML project with a friend. We built an ML app with a cloud instance to enhance recorded autobiographies with NLP-generated insights!”\\nShahid Mahmood\\nCTO & Co-Founder, How I Remember It, Inc.\\n“I’m a Computational Scientist with a Ph. D. in theoretical nuclear phsyics. I was working on a research project that involved archeological datasets that eventually led to a publication. The foundations of machine learning from Andrew’s class were essential in making it happen.”\\nChrysovalantis Constantinou\\nComputational Scientist, Cyprus Institute\\n“Andrew’s teaching style helped me grasp foundational concepts. The newly acquired knowledge from the Machine Learning course helped me land a second postdoctoral position, run tutorials for two data science courses, and write my first machine learning paper!”\\nYouness Bo\""

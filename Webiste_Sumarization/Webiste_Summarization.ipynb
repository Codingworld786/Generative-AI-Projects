      "A look at the rise in viewership of IPL matches in 2025\n",
      "IPL is valued at $12 billion, and its popularity in India is well-known. The first eight matches drew 288 million viewers, but by the 26th match, that figure had risen to 450 million, and all the credit goes to the new captains, different team combinations, changing regulations, and rivalries.\n",
      "Credit: X | @rcb\n",
      "On June 3, after winning the toss, Punjab Kings chose to bowl first against RCB for the first innings in the IPL finals. According to the live cricket score data, RCB has scored 14 runs from 1.1 overs with the loss of zero wickets in the first innings of the IPL finals.\n",
      "During the first over, more than 9.2 crore (92 million) people streamed the match on Jio Hotstar.\n",

      "In the leading chart, RCB matches drew massive audiences, with their highest-viewed game clocking an astounding number of 57.8 crore views on June 3, RCB vs PBKS finals.\n",
      "Credit: Reddit | @sachinkr4325\n",
      "This is followed by the clash between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and RCB, which garnered 41.4 crore views. Followed by an intense rivalry between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and RCB that also captivated fans, with their matches drawing 37.3 crore and 34 crore views, respectively.\n",
      "Did IPL 2025 break the advertising records with Jio Hotstar?\n",
      "With franchise values reaching all-time highs, the tournament has grown into a billion-dollar spectacle. The eight original teams now command valuations of up to $2 billion, with top franchises like Mumbai Indians (MI), Chennai Super Kings (CSK), and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) leading the series.\n",
      "On the other hand, Jio Hotstar aimed to generate RS 4,500 crore in ad revenue through 32 significant sponsorship deals and a drive for 100 million paid streaming customers. IPL 2025 is predicted to shatter previous advertising records.\n",
